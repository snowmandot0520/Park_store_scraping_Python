Known as \u201cProject C,\u201d the confrontation brought nationwide media attention as nonviolent protesters werethreatened by unleashed police dogs and high-pressure hoses.

On the morning of 27 March 1814, General Andrew Jackson and an army of 3,300 men consisting ofTennessee militia, United States regulars and both Cherokee and Lower Creek allies attacked Chief Menawa and 1,000Upper Creek warriors fortified in the \"horseshoe\" bend of the Tallapoosa River. To seal off the bend of the river,the Upper Creeks built an incredibly strong 400 yard long barricade made of dirt and logs. As the Cherokee andLower Creek warriors swam the Tallapoosa and attacked from the rear, Jackson launched the militia and regularsoldiers against the barricade. Facing overwhelming odds, the Upper Creeks fought bravely yet ultimately lost thebattle. Over 800 Upper Creeks died at Horseshoe Bend defending their homeland. This was the final battle of theCreek War of 1813-14, which is considered part of the War of 1812.  In a peace treaty signed after the battle, both the Upper and Lower Creeks were forced to give the UnitedStates nearly 20 million acres of land in what is today Alabama and Georgia. The victory here brought AndrewJackson national attention and helped him to be elected the seventh President of the United States in 1828.",

The final push to achieve a nationwide solution to the disenfranchisementof African Americans came as the result of three strategically planned marches, the first of which took place onMarch 7. Nearly 500 marchers proceeded through the streets of Selma and across the Edmund Pettus Bridge where theywere faced by scores of Alabama State troopers. The troopers attacked the non-violent marchers, leaving many ofthem bloodied and severely injured, on a date forever ensconced in history as \" Bloody Sunday\".  A second march ended in a prayer session at the point of Sunday's confrontation. When an injunctioncircumventing the march to the Alabama State Capitol was reversed, a plan was devised to conduct the monumentaltrek on Sunday, March 21, 1965. Thousands of people, representing many races and nationalities, moved before theeyes of the world in demonstration to guarantee the right to vote. The five-day/four-night event covered a 54-mileroute along state Highway 80 through chilling weather and rain. The result was the personal triumph of those whoparticipated in the historic trek and the signing of the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965.  Today, the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail stands as a testament to the sacrifices made inthe triumph to preserve the right to vote as the bedrock of American democracy.   ",

The sky was the limit--literally! After the successful flight of Orville and Wilbur Wright in 1903,Americans of all races were stung by the love bug of flight. In the late 1920's and 1930's African Americans ingreat numbers began their love affair with flight. They learned the basics of flight on either American soil orabroad, and created their own flight schools and clubs.  This love affair was kindled in the late 1930's, when the United States Government created Civilian PilotTraining Programs throughout the country to provide a surplus of pilots in case of a national emergency. AfricanAmericans were included in these programs, although trained at segregated facilities.  Their love of flight became fully ablaze amid World War II as political pressure challenged thegovernment to expand the role of African Americans in the military. The Army Air Corps was the first agency toaccept the challenge. Tuskegee Institute, a small black college in Alabama, was selected to host the \"militaryexperiment\" to train African American pilots and support staff--thus the Tuskegee Airmen were born.  The outstanding performance of the over 15,000 men and women who shared the \"Tuskegee Experience\" from1942-1946, is immortalized at the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site.",

During the Pleistocene Epoch, orlast Ice Age, glaciers in the northern region of the earth locked up water in the area, causing the sea levels todrop and exposing the land beneath the Bering Strait. Animals, plants, and people migrated from one continent toanother across this flat, grassy plain. As the Ice Age ended and the earth warmed, glaciers melted and the sealevels rose again, submerging most of the land bridge.

                "description": "Offering rim to rim hiking, mule rides, and whitewater rafting, Grand Canyon National Park is a hugelypopular national park destination. Grand Canyon National Park encompasses canyons, river tributaries, and surrounding grounds. The GrandCanyon is situated in Arizona's northwestern quadrant. With millions of visitors making the trip to the canyoneach year, this park is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world. In addition, the park has beena UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979.The Grand Canyon had a long and arduous road to becoming a national park, beginning in the 1880s withseveral failed congressional bills. After making multiple visits to the area, Theodore Roosevelt declared theGrand Canyon a National Monument in 1908. The bill to grant national park status to the area was passed in 1919and signed by then-President Woodrow Wilson.There are two public areas of Grand Canyon National Park, the North and South Rims. At 7,000 feet abovesea level, the Grand Canyon South Rim is the most accessible section of the national park, with numerous placeswhere visitors can pull over to admire the views. The Grand Canyon North Rim, 1,000 feet higher than its southernsibling, isn't as popular because it is harder to get to, especially when harsh winter weather closes accessroads. By car, the trip from one rim to the other is 220 miles. However, if traveling by foot, the distance acrossthe canyon is 21 miles via the Kaibab Trails.      ",

Ancestral Puebloans and Kaibab Paiute Indians gathered grass seeds, hunted animals, and raisedcrops near the springs for at least 1,000 years. In the 1860s Mormon pioneers brought cattle to the area and by1872 a fort (Winsor Castle) was built over the mainspring and a large cattle ranching operation was established.  This isolated outpost served as a way station for people traveling across the Arizona Strip, that part ofArizona separated from the rest of the state by the Grand Canyon. It also served as a refuge for polygamist wivesduring the 1880s and 1890s. Although their way of life was greatly impacted, the Paiute Indians continued to livein the area and by 1907 the Kaibab Paiute Indian Reservation was established, surrounding the privately owned PipeSpring ranch. In 1923 the Pipe Spring ranch was purchased and set aside as a national monument.",

In 1686, Henri de Tonti established a trading post known as \"Poste de Arkansea\" at the Quapaw villageof Osotouy. It was the first semi-permanent French settlement in the lower Mississippi River Valley. Theestablishment of the Post was the first step in a long struggle between France, Spain, and England over theinterior of the North American continent.  Over the years, the Post relocated as necessary due to flooding from the Arkansas River, but its positionalways served of strategic importance for the French, Spanish, American, and Confederate military. Spanishsoldiers and British partisans clashed here in the 1783 \"Colbert Raid,\" the only Revolutionary War action inArkansas.  Arkansas Post became part of the United States following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. By 1819, thepost was a thriving river port and the largest city in the region and selected as the first capital of theArkansas Territory.  During the Civil War, Confederate troops tried to maintain tactical control of the confluence of the tworivers, and in 1862 they constructed a massive earthen fortification known as Fort Hindman at the Post. In January1863 Union troops destroyed the fort, ensuring control of the Arkansas River.  Today, the memorial and museum commemorate the multi-layered and complex history of the site. Located ona peninsula bordered by the Arkansas River and two backwaters, the site offers excellent fishing and wildlifewatching opportunities.   ",

On the 7th and 8th of that month, nearly 26,000 soldiers fought to determine whether Missouri wouldremain under Union control, and whether or not Federal armies could continue their offensive south through theMississippi River Valley.  Major General Earl Van Dorn led 16,000 Confederates against 10,250 Union soldiers, under the command ofBrigadier General Samuel R. Curtis. The Confederate force also included some 800 Cherokees fighting for theConfederacy, while half of the Federals were German immigrants.  The park also includes a two and one half mile segment of the Trail of Tears. The Elkhorn Tavern, site ofbitter fighting on both days, is a NPS reconstruction on the site of the original. The park is one of the mostwell preserved battlefields in the United States.   ",

Operated under the terms of Executive Order 9066 from 1942-1945, over 10,000 people of Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of them American citizens, passed through Amache. At its peak population in 1943, 7,310 people were detained in Amache, making it the tenth largest city in Colorado at the time.   Though the original buildings associated with the incarceration site were removed or demolished after Amache closed in 1945, Amache represents one of the most intact examples of a World War II incarceration site. Today, Amache National Historic Site consists of a historic cemetery, a monument, concrete building foundations, the historic road network, and several reconstructed and rehabilitated structures from the camp era.   The designation of the Amache National Historic Site is an important step in telling a more complete story of the Japanese American incarceration during World War II. Many survivors, their descendants, and the Amache Preservation Society were instrumental in obtaining the initial National Historic Landmark designation and advocating for the site to become part of the National Park System.",

Chivington led 675 U.S. volunteer soldiers to a village of about 500 Cheyenne and Arapaho people campedalong the banks of Big Sandy Creek in southeastern Colorado. Although the Cheyenne and Arapaho, under Chiefs BlackKettle, White Antelope, and Left Hand, believed they were under the protection of the U.S. Army, Chivington'stroops attacked and killed about 230 people, composed mostly of women, children, and the elderly.   Sand Creek gave rise to a newgeneration of federal policies, new treaties at the Little Arkansas and Medicine Lodge, and the next generation offighters and fights: Beecher Island, Washita, Summit Springs, Palo Duro Canyon, Sappa Creek, and the LittleBighorn. Sand Creek is among our nation's most profound historic places. The event remains a powerful, and tosome, sacred symbol of sacrifice and struggle.   Each November, an annual SandCreek Spiritual Healing Run/Walk commemorates those killed in the Sand Creek Massacre, providing healing for allpeople, regardless of ethnicity, race, or religion. The 173-mile run, started by Lee Lone Bear, a NorthernCheyenne descendant of massacre survivors, represents the route used by the soldiers returning to Denver after themassacre. ",

In the summer of 1882, American Impressionist painter J. Alden Weir boarded a train from New Yorkbound for his modest farm among rolling hills in Branchville, Connecticut. Far from the commotion of the city,Weir and his family transformed their summer retreat into a creative refuge for friends and fellow artists.  The landscape of Weir Farm has now been a source of inspiration for artists for more than 120 years.Three artists, American Impressionist Julian Alden Weir, sculptor Mahonri Young and painter Sperry Andrews, madethe farm their home. Today, the 60-acre National Historical Park preserves not only the homes, studios and barnsof the farm, but also the rolling hills, fields, and distinctive stone walls that still inspire visitors andpainters today.",

This attack drew the United States into World War II, and changed the course of global history in the20th century.   To commemorate the many liveslost during the attack, the Pearl Harbor National Memorial was constructed at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam onOahu Island in Hawaii.

The founding of the Hawaiian kingdom can be directly associated with one structure in the HawaiianIslands: Pu'ukohola Heiau. The temple was constructed to incur the favor of the war god Kuka'ilimoku. Builtbetween 1790-91 by Kamehameha I (also known as Kamehameha the Great), together with chiefs, commoners, men, womenand children. As British sailor John Young looked on, the temple was built and dedicated, a chief rival wassacrificed, and the war god Ku was pleased.  Kamehameha I waged several subsequent battles using Western military strategy and weapons to extend hiscontrol over all Hawaiian Islands. The monarchy he established lasted 83 years, from 1810-1893.   ",

The rural community flourished at first, but later declined and dissolved in 1885.   The town of New Philadelphia dissolved over the years as plows turned over the land, but the town's story has survived through historical documents, oral histories from town descendants and community members, and artifacts. Several organizations and individuals have worked together to protect and interpret the site and conduct archeological and historical research to learn more. The protection of the original location will permanently safeguard it for future generations and is currently managed by the New Philadelphia Association.

In 1880, the Pullman Palace CarCompany broke ground on its own industrial community, consisting of factories andinfrastructure, including streets, a town, and housing for its workers. By 1883, over 8,000 workers lived inPullman. Over the next decade, orders declined and wages were cut, but rent charged for company housing was not.Soon workers were left with starvation wages as corporate dividends remained undisturbed. A strike broke outin May 1894 and factory workers walked out after failed negotiations for better wages and living conditions. Thisled to a national boycott of handling Pullman cars, drastically affecting rail traffic across the country, andviolence and vandalism broke out as soldiers were dispatched to aid local authorities. The strike was eventuallyquelled by an injunction from the Supreme Court, but its effects were far-reaching.   In 1925, A. Phillip Randolphfounded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), the first African American labor union. At the time,porters made up 44% of the Pullman workforce, making it the nation's largest employer of African Americans.

The monument contains nationally significant archeological resources including (original) survivingexamples of earthen American Indian mound groups that provide an insight into the social, ceremonial, political,and economic life of the Eastern Woodland people. Two hundred and six pre-European contact mounds are preservedhere\u2014of which 31 are effigies in the shape of bears and birds. Natural features in the monument include forests,tallgrass prairies, wetlands, and rivers. As a sacred site to the modern descendants of the moundbuilders, parkaccess is offered via fourteen miles of hiking trails.  Eastern Woodland Indians built mounds from about 500 BC until the early European contact period. A uniqueEffigy Mound culture developed in this area of the Upper Midwest placing thousands of mounds in the shape ofanimals across the landscape. Others are conical, linear, or compound shapes; many of the conical are burialmounds. Some effigy mound groups were built to a monumental scale; the Marching Bear Group, containing 10 bear andthree bird effigies, stretches nearly one quarter mile along a bluff top overlooking the Upper Mississippi River.

Tallgrass prairie once covered more than 140 million acres of the United States, from Indiana toKansas and from Canada to Texas. Nearly all of it is gone, plowed under for agriculture. An ancient past survivesin the irreplaceable Flint Hills tallgrass.  In prehistory, what is now a sea of grass, was once a shallow sea of water. Two hundred to 300 millionyears ago the gray and white rock limestone and steel tough chert commonly called \"flint\" began to form from thisPermian Sea floor. The result was shallow, rocky land considered unsuitable for plowing but excellent for pasture.The natural prairie cycle of weather, wildfires, and animal grazing -- once bison, now cattle -- has sustained thetallgrass prairie and its diverse plant and animal species ever since.  Now you can find over 500 species of plants, nearly 150 species of birds, 39 species of reptiles andamphibians, and 31 species of mammals. Much of the prairie flora and fauna is far too tiny to be seen from apassing car. For those who take the time to stop and look closer, a subtle world of special beauty and naturalwonder is waiting.

Comprised of a cluster of islands along the jagged Maine coast and a section of mainland on the Schoodic Peninsula, Acadia National Park has a variety of landscapes including granite-domed mountains, woodlands, lakes, ponds, and ocean shoreline. More than two dozen mountains rise above the rocky shore, including Cadillac Mountain, which at 1,530 feet is the highest point on the U.S. Atlantic coast.  Hiking and biking are popular Acadia National Park activities. There are more than 130 miles of hiking trails to explore by foot and 45 miles of carriage roads to travel by bike. These byways were established and maintained in the 19th and early 20th centuries by local improvement societies.  In 1919, Acadia became the first national park established east of the Mississippi River. Following the footsteps of the earliest advocates of the parks, a generous conservationist protected and donated 6,000 acres of land for the creation of Acadia National Park.  The National Park Foundation has long been an advocate for Acadia, including a recent completed program to improve views of the spectacular night sky, as Acadia is one of the best places on the east coast to view the Milky Way.",

Saint Croix Island International Historic Site is a monument to the beginning of the United Statesand Canada. In 1604, Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons, accompanied by Samuel Champlain and 77 other men, established asettlement on St. Croix Island. Preceding Jamestown (1607) and Plymouth (1620), Pierre Dugua's outpost was one ofthe earliest European settlements on the North Atlantic coast of North America. More specifically, it was thefirst attempt by the French at year-round colonization in the territory they called La Cadie or l'Acadie.  The settlement was short-lived, however, and in the summer of 1605, the French moved to a more favorablelocation where they established the Port Royal Habitation on the shores of the present-day Annapolis Basin, NovaScotia.  From St. Croix Island, Samuel Champlain explored and charted the coast of Norembegue (Norumbega),including the Bay of Fundy and the Atlantic coast as far south as Cape Cod. The valuable insights gained from boththe St. Croix settlement and further exploration formed the foundation for a more successful settlement at PortRoyal, and an enduring French presence in North American continuing to the present day.

Begun as a major arsenal under the authority of General George Washington early in the RevolutionaryWar, the first national armory began manufacturing muskets in 1794. Within decades, Springfield Armory hadperfected pioneering manufacturing methods that were critical to American industrialization. On a chill Springmorning in 1968, amid speeches and farewell addresses, the men and women of Springfield Armory bid each othergoodbye as the Stars and Stripes were lowered for the last time. After nearly two centuries of continuousproduction of rifles and muskets used by America's armed forces in every war in the nation's history, the armoryclosed its gates and fell silent. Reopened in 1978, the original 1840s arsenal houses the world's largestcollection of American military firearms.",

More recently came theeastern investors and immigrants in one of the nation's first large mineral rushes. Copper built thrivingindustries and cosmopolitan communities in this remote, wild place. Mining companies like Calumet & Hecla andQuincy left a lasting mark on the land, communities and people. When the mines closed, their loss brought hardshipand heartache.

Pipestone National Monument offers an opportunity to explore American Indian culture and the naturalresources of the tallgrass prairie. Established by Congress in 1937 to protect the historic pipestone quarries,the site is considered sacred by many American Indians. Spanning centuries of use, American Indians continue toquarry pipestone which they carve into sacred pipes.  Stone pipes were long known among the prehistoric peoples of North America; specimens from 2,000 yearsago have been found at Mound City in present-day Ohio. Digging at this Minnesota quarry likely began in the 17thcentury, a time which coincided with the acquisition of metal tools from European traders. Carvers prized thisdurable yet relatively soft stone, which ranged from mottled pink to brick red. By all accounts this location cameto be the preferred source of pipestone among the Plains tribes. By about 1700, though, the Dakota Siouxcontrolled the quarries and distributed the stone only through trade.   ",

Upon his return from the war, Medgar marriedhis classmate at Alcorn State University, Myrlie Beasley, and got involved with the Regional Council of NegroLeadership (RCNL), a civil rights and pro self-help organization. Medgar applied to the then-segregated law schoolat the University of Mississippi in 1954, and when his application was rejected, became the focus of a NAACPcampaign to desegregate the school. Medgar and Myrlie opened and managed the first NAACP Mississippi State Officeand lived under constant threats as they fought against racial inequality, leading boycotts, organizing voterregistration drives, and investigating acts of violence against African Americans, including the 1955 murder ofEmmett Till.   On June 12, 1963, Medgar Everswas murdered in the carport of their home. Medgar's death would become one of the events that led to the eventualpassage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, Myrlie did not see justice for the murder of her husband until31 years later.

Sherman ordered several advances from Federally controlled Memphisinto north Mississippi for the purpose of keeping Forrest occupied in Mississippi and not behind his line in eastTennessee, cutting communication and supply lines.  On July 13-15, 1864, the Battle of Tupelo was the result of one of those advances by Major General AndrewJ. Smith.

During a nationwidecompetition in 1947-48, architect Eero Saarinen's inspired design for a 630 foot stainless steel arch was chosenas a perfect monument to the spirit of the western pioneers. Construction of the Arch began in 1963 and wascompleted on October 28, 1965, for a total cost of less than $15 million. The Arch has foundations sunk 60 feetinto the ground, and is built to withstand earthquakes and high winds. It sways up to one inch in a 20 mph wind,and is built to sway up to 18 inches.  The Museum of Westward Expansion, located below the Arch, is as large as a football field and contains anextensive collection of artifacts, mounted animal specimens, an authentic American Indian tipi, and an overview ofthe Lewis and Clark expedition.  Located just two blocks west of the Arch, the Old Courthouse is one of the oldest standing buildings inSt. Louis, begun in 1839.

This area memorializes one of the last armed efforts of the Northern Plains Indians to preserve theirway of life. Here in 1876, 263 soldiers and attached personnel of the U.S. Army, including Lt. Col. George A.Custer, met death at the hands of several thousand Lakota and Cheyenne warriors. In the spring and summer of 1876,the United States Government launched a military campaign upon a portion of the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians, whorefused to live within the boundaries of the Great Sioux Reservation. The Seventh Cavalry and their Indian alliesattacked a village of 6,000 to 7,000 people on June 25, 1876. 350 7th Cavalrymen survived.

During the Miocene, when the land was a grass savanna, it was home to prehistoric creatures such asthe Dinohyus (giant pig-like animal), Stenomylus (small gazelle-camel), and Menoceras (short rhinoceros). Theseanimals' hoofprints, as well as layers of fossilized bones, can be found throughout Agate. To preserve these richfossil deposits and their geological contexts, the park was founded amidst today's natural ecosystem.   Visitors to the park can also explore the more recent history of the area. The monument's museumcollection contains many interesting artifacts from the era when Captain James H.

The Underground Railroad refers to efforts of enslaved African Americans to gain their freedom byescaping bondage. Wherever slavery existed, there were efforts to escape, at first to maroon communities in remoteor rugged terrain on the edge of settled areas. Their acts of self-emancipation made them 'fugitives' according tothe laws of the times, though in retrospect 'freedom seeker' seems a more accurate description. While most freedomseekers began their journey unaided and many completed their self-emancipation without assistance, each decade inwhich slavery was legal in the United States saw an increase in active efforts to assist escape. In many cases thedecision to assist a freedom seeker may have been a spontaneous reaction as the opportunity presented itself.However, in some places, particularly after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, the Underground Railroad wasdeliberate and organized.",

Excavation of the West Ruin in the 1900suncovered thousands of well-preserved artifacts that provide a glimpse into the life of Ancestral Pueblo people,connecting people of the past with people and traditions of today.   Many Southwestern AmericanIndians today maintain deep spiritual ties with this ancestral site. Visitors today can learn about theseremarkable people and their descendants and connect with the monument's timeless landscape and stories. A shorttrail winds through this massive site offering a surprisingly intimate experience. Along the way visitors willdiscover original roofs, plaster walls, a reed mat left by the inhabitants, intriguing T shaped doorways,provocative north-facing corner doors, and more. The trail culminates with the reconstructed great kiva, abuilding that inherently inspires contemplation, wonder, and an ancient sense of sacredness.    ",

A reliable waterhole hidden at its base made El Morro (or Inscription Rock) a popular campsite.Beginning in the late 1500s Spaniards, and later Americans, passed by El Morro. While they rested in its shade anddrank from the pool, many carved their signatures, dates, and messages.  Before the Spanish, petroglyphs were inscribed by Ancestral Puebloans living on top of the bluff over 700years ago. The softness of the sandstone made it easy to carve pictures, names, dates and messages. Ironically,that is also the reason that the famous inscriptions are slowly disappearing. Today, El Morro National Monumentprotects over 2,000 inscriptions and petroglyphs, as well as Ancestral Puebloan ruins.",

There was money to be made in transporting New Mexico serapesand other woolen goods to Los Angeles, and in wrangling California-bred horses and mules back to Santa Fe. But aviable overland route across the remote deserts and mountains of Mexico's far northern frontier had to be found.It took the vision and courage of Mexican trader Antonio Armijo to lead the first commercial caravan from Abiqui,New Mexico, to Los Angeles late in 1829.  Over the next 20 years, Mexican and American traders continued to ply variants of the route that Armijopioneered, frequently trading with Indian tribes along the way. And it was from a combination of the indigenousfootpaths, early trade and exploration routes, and horse and mule routes that a trail network known collectivelyas the Old Spanish Trail evolved. Santa Fe emerged as the hub of the overland continental trade network linkingMexico and United States markets'a network that included not only the Old Spanish Trail, but also the Santa FeTrail and El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. After the United States took control of the Southwest in 1848 otherroutes to California emerged, and use of the Old Spanish Trail sharply declined.",

From the late 17th through the early 18th centuries, free and enslaved Africans were buried in a 6.6 acre cemetery in what is now Lower Manhattan, outside the boundaries of the settlement of New Amsterdam (now New York). Lost and forgotten because of centuries of development and landfill, this burial ground for an estimated 15,000 Africans was discovered by construction workers during excavation for a federal office building in 1991. The remains of 419 men, women and children recovered at that time provided extensive insight into the lives of some of the earliest African settlers in America.",

The Southwest Battery was constructed on the rocks off the tip of Manhattan Island between 1808 and1811. Although fully armed, the fort never had occasion to fire upon an enemy. In 1817, the fort was renamedCastle Clinton in honor of DeWitt Clinton, Mayor and later Governor of New York.  The army vacated the fort in 1821 and the structure was deeded to New York City in 1823. On August 3,1855, Castle Garden, now leased to New York State, opened as an immigrant landing depot. During the next 34 years,over 8 million people entered the United States through Castle Garden, until it was closed on April 18, 1890. Thebuilding was altered once again and reopened as the New York City Aquarium on December 10, 1896. It was one of thecity's most popular attractions until it closed in 1941.",

As the first Secretary of the Treasury (1789-1795) he devised plansfor funding the national debt, securing federal credit, encouraging expansion of manufacturing, and organizing thefederal bank. Hamilton commissioned architect John McComb Jr. to design a Federal style country home on asprawling 32 acre estate in upper Manhattan.

It's built and maintained primarily by volunteers from the North Country Trail Association and its partners.   The National Park Foundation is supporting the North Country Trail by providing funds for a standardized chainsaw training program and the necessary personal protective equipment for volunteers across the trail's 4,800 miles to ensure the trail is safe and accessible for users. It also works closely with the trail's primary partner, the North Country Trail Association, which has recently received capacity building grants for the creation of a Trail Protection program that will enable NCTA to secure access to and protect the landscape of the trail, as well as the development of a campaign plan to increase NCTA's ability to sustain its maintenance, protection, and promotion of the trail long into the future.

Designated as a National Scenic Trail in 1980, the North Country Trail begins in Middlebury, Vermont and ends in Lake Sakakawea State Park in North Dakota, connecting both the Long Trail and the Appalachian Trail with the Lewis and Clark Trail. The trail was recognized as an official unit of the National Park Service in 2023 and is managed in partnership with federal, state, and local agencies. It's built and maintained primarily by volunteers from the North Country Trail Association and its partners.   The National Park Foundation is supporting the North Country Trail by providing funds for a standardized chainsaw training program and the necessary personal protective equipment for volunteers across the trail's 4,800 miles to ensure the trail is safe and accessible for users. It also works closely with the trail's primary partner, the North Country Trail Association, which has recently received capacity building grants for the creation of a Trail Protection program that will enable NCTA to secure access to and protect the landscape of the trail, as well as the development of a campaign plan to increase NCTA's ability to sustain its maintenance, protection, and promotion of the trail long into the future.

Poe's 6 years in Philadelphia,1838-1844, were his most productive. Not only did Poe edit and provide critical reviews for very successfulmagazines, but he also invented the modern detective story.  While living in Philadelphia, Poe went from the high of being a popular lecturer to the despair oflearning that his wife Virginia was ill with tuberculosis. The brief and tragic life of the author, his times, andliterary legacy are interpreted in the building that once sheltered Poe and his family.",

NPF's Flight 93 National Memorial Campaign raised over $40 million in private support to establish,design, and construct the park. This funded the construction of the park's Memorial Plaza, Wall of Names, 40Memorial Groves, and Field of Honor. The campaign also supports reforestation efforts in the park, including anannual volunteer tree planting event. Since 2012, more than 4,000 vounteers have planted more than 136,000 nativetree seedlings across 197 acres at the park. The Flight 93 National Memorial Campaign also helped establish theFriends of Flight 93 National Memorial, the park's official charitable partner organization that provides ongoingprivate support to the park.  Shortly after terrorists flew airplanes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York andinto the Pentagon in Virginia, the 40 passengers and crew members on United Airlines Flight 93 fought a battle inthe sky over Pennsylvania. These 40 heroes voted and decided to fight back, thwarting a planned attack on ournation's capital. They saved the lives of many others, but sacrificed their own in a field just east of Pittsburghin Somerset County, Pennsylvania.  This was a day our country was shaken to its very foundation when terrorists coordinated hijacking offour commercial airlines in a strategically planned attack against the United States. Despite the destruction anddevastation, stories of courage and heroism emerged.",

To properly bury the Union soldiers who died at Gettysburg, a \"Soldiers Cemetery\"was established on the battleground near the center of the Union line.

Here were written the two documents, theDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution, on which the foundations of our country rest. Here, from 1790 to1800, when Philadelphia was the nation's capital, the principle of governance based on the rights of individualcitizens was first tested.  Through a series of events, which in retrospect seem almost miraculous, many of the buildings in whichthese events took place were preserved.

Elias Unger, thepresident of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, was hoping that the people in Johnstown were heeding thetelegraph warnings sent earlier, which said that the dam might go. When it finally happened, at 3:10 P.M., May 31,1889, an era of the Conemaugh Valley's history ended, and another era started. Over 2,209 people died on thattragic Friday, and thousands more were injured in one of the worst disasters in our Nation's history.

It's built and maintained primarily by volunteers from the North Country Trail Association and its partners.   The National Park Foundation is supporting the North Country Trail by providing funds for a standardized chainsaw training program and the necessary personal protective equipment for volunteers across the trail's 4,800 miles to ensure the trail is safe and accessible for users. It also works closely with the trail's primary partner, the North Country Trail Association, which has recently received capacity building grants for the creation of a Trail Protection program that will enable NCTA to secure access to and protect the landscape of the trail, as well as the development of a campaign plan to increase NCTA's ability to sustain its maintenance, protection, and promotion of the trail long into the future.

A trap door under the bema is symbolic of their fear and apprehension. But in America they, likemillions of others, found the religious toleration they had so long sought.  In his famous letter to \"The Hebrew Congregation in Newport,\" written in 1790, President GeorgeWashington pledged that the new nation would\" give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance\" andthereby set the standard for religious freedom and civil liberties in America.

This unique national park incorporates several sites around Charleston Harbor that help share the uniquestories of the places and people that shaped our history. Sullivan's Island has long served as Charleston Harbor's first line of defense. Quarantine stations,constructed to prevent the spread of disease, checked every person that came into the harbor, including Africanswho were enslaved, and formal fortifications sought to defend against foreign invasion. Fort Moultrie, the firstfort on Sullivan's Island, was attacked in June 1776 by the Royal Navy while the fort was still incomplete andmanaged to drive out the British forces after nine hours of battle. Another fort was built in its place after theBritish captured Charleston in 1780, and a third brick Fort Moultrie was completed by 1809 after the second hadsuffered from neglect and a destructive hurricane. Fort Moultrie, named in honor of the commander who fought offthe Royal Navy in 1776, was modernized throughout the latter half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20thcentury and today the fort has been restored to portray the major periods of its complex history, from thePalmetto-log fort of 1776 to the World War II Harbor Entrance Control Post.  The nearby Fort Sumter was constructed on a man-made island as part of the Third System of SeacoastDefense \u2013 a network of forts meant to strengthen maritime defenses after the War of 1812. On April 21, 1861,following a chain reaction of social, economic, and political events, the first shots of the Civil War were firedat Fort Sumter. The Confederates garrisoned Fort Sumter for almost four years as the fort became the focus of along defense. The Siege of Charleston continued until February 17, 1865 \u2013 the longest siege in U.S. militaryhistory \u2013 and left the former three-tiered brick and masonry fort effectively a pile of rubble. Today the fort isaccessible by boat, and visitors can enjoy ranger talks and wayside exhibits that explore the fort's history andsignificance. Visitors to Charleston can also enjoy picnicking and casual recreational activities in outside theFort Sumter Visitor Education Center, located in Charleston's Liberty Square.",

The unconditional Surrender of Fort Donelson created jubilation throughout the North and silence inDixie. It was the North's first major victory of the Civil War, opening the way into the very heart of theConfederacy.  February 14th, 1862 dawned cold and quiet. Early in the afternoon a furious roar broke thestillness. Union gunboats arrived at Fort Donelson and began exchanging iron valentines with the Confederate heavyartillery. The gunboats suffered such damage that the decks became slippery with blood. The strong artillerybombardment from the Cumberland River bluff crippled the ironclads, forcing them to retreat.  At daybreak the following morning, on a snow covered battleground, Southern forces launched a vigorousattack but failed to escape the clutches of Grant's army. On February 16th General Buckner felt compelled toaccept Grant's ultimatum: no terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. The gate wasopen for a Union invasion into the Confederate Heartland.  In 1867, Fort Donelson Cemetery was established as the final resting place for Union soldiers and sailorsinitially buried in the Fort Donelson area.   ",

The Manhattan Project National Historical Park helps preserve thisimportant time in history. Though the National Park Service and the Department of Energy are collaborating toprovide as much access as possible, many areas in the park are not currently open to the public.  Located on the Columbia River, the main purpose of the Hanford Engineer Works was to create largequantities of plutonium. Some homeowners and Native American tribes were displaced to make room for the massivefacility, once home to over 50,000 workers. Tours are offered regularly from April-September, but requireregistration by internet, phone, or in person.  The atomic bombs were designed and built in Los Alamos, through the efforts of more than 6,000 scientistsand workers. There are three main areas of significance at Los Alamos including the Gun Site Facilities, where the'Little Boy' bomb was designed, the V-Site Facilities, where parts for the Trinity device were assembled, and thePajarito Site, which was used for additional assembly and research. There is currently no public access to DOEfacilities, but walking tours are available in the town of Los Alamos.  The Oak Ridge Reservation in rural eastern Tennessee was an industrial complex and city home to over75,000. This complex served as the headquarters for the Manhattan Project as well as a center for plutoniumproduction and uranium enrichment. The three areas of interest in Oak Ridge include the X-10 Graphite ReactorNational Historic Landmark, Buildings 9731 and 9204-3 at the Y-12 complex, and the location of the K-25 Building.These buildings were used for uranium enrichment, while the X-10 reactor produced plutonium. On weekdays Junethrough August, the public can tour these sites via bus by purchasing an admission ticket to the American Museumof Science and Energy.",

People have called the Big Thicket an American ark and the biological crossroads of North America.The preserve was established to protect its complex biological diversity. What is extraordinary is not the rarityor abundance of its life forms, but how many species coexist here. Once vast, this combination of pine and cypressforest, hardwood forest, meadow, and blackwater swamp is but a remnant. With such varied habitats, \"Big Thicket\"is a misnomer, but it seems appropriate.  A convergence of ecosystems occurred here during the last Ice Age. It brought together, in onegeographical location, the eastern hardwood forests, the Gulf coastal plains, and the midwest prairies. ThePreserve consists of nine land units and six water corridors encompassing more than 97,000 acres. On December 15,1981, the Preserve was designated an International Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations Education, Scientificand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Man and the Biosphere Program.

Like many states across the south, segregated education was practiced in the 19th and early 20th century in Texas, though there was no state law that mandated separate schools for Hispanic students. Texas school districts perpetuated the practice of de facto segregation, with Hispanic students attending two-room adobe building now known as the Blackwell School. The school, named for longtime principal Jesse Blackwell, grew as more buildings were constructed next to the schoolhouse to accommodate a growing student population. Blackwell School, served hundreds of Hispanic children up to the ninth grade and closed in 1965 following the integration of the Marfa Independent School District.  Today, the site consists of the original 1909 adobe schoolhouse and a smaller 1927 classroom building, known as the Band Hall. Visitors the park can explore photographs, memorabilia, and interpretive panels that feature quotes and stories from students and teachers. The site is currently managed by the Blackwell School Alliance, a local nonprofit founded by alumni in 2006 for the purpose of preserving the school.",

The wharf area of Christiansted once played an important rolein the mercantilist system that linked Europe, West Africa, the West Indies, and North America. From 1734 until1803, it was part of the infamous Triangular Trade. Slaves were acquired for cheap manufactured goods atfactories, or slaving forts, along the Guinea Coast of West Africa, and shipped to the West Indies via theinhumane Middle Passage.  At Christiansted, the slaves were auctioned off, and the ships cargoes replenished with local exportsbound for Europe and North America. Building materials, agricultural supplies, household furnishings, livestock,and foodstuffs were imported to help St. Croix meet the needs of its vigorous plantation economy. In turn, theisland exported sugar, molasses, rum, cotton, and tropical hardwood. Especially between 1760 and 1820, wealthderived from sugar, rum, and slaves enabled an extravagant life style among the upper class of St. Croix society.  The United States market accounted for approximately 75% of St. Croix's agricultural exports by 1830. Thesale of the Danish West Indies to the United States in 1917 only formalized an economic relationship that had longexisted between the Virgin Islands and the mainland.",

A nearly 100-mile long warp in the Earth'scrust, the Waterpocket Fold is a classic monocline: a regional fold with one very steep side in an area ofotherwise nearly horizontal layers. A monocline is a \"step-up\" in the rock layers. The rock layers on the westside of the Waterpocket Fold have been lifted more than 7000 feet higher than the layers on the east. Major foldsare almost always associated with underlying faults.  The Waterpocket Fold formed between 50 and 70 million years ago when a major mountain building event inwestern North America, the Laramide Orogeny, reactivated an ancient buried fault. When the fault moved, theoverlying rock layers were draped above the fault and formed a monocline.",

It's built and maintained primarily by volunteers from the North Country Trail Association and its partners.   The National Park Foundation is supporting the North Country Trail by providing funds for a standardized chainsaw training program and the necessary personal protective equipment for volunteers across the trail's 4,800 miles to ensure the trail is safe and accessible for users. It also works closely with the trail's primary partner, the North Country Trail Association, which has recently received capacity building grants for the creation of a Trail Protection program that will enable NCTA to secure access to and protect the landscape of the trail, as well as the development of a campaign plan to increase NCTA's ability to sustain its maintenance, protection, and promotion of the trail long into the future.

Fort Monroe is considered to be a site of African Americancultural significance as a result of the historical events that took place here during the Civil War.  The Battle of Sewell's Point and notably the Battle of Big Bethel both took place near Fort Monroe, whichplayed a critical role in the battles. However, on May 27, 1861, Major General Benjamin Butler made the famous\"Fort Monroe Doctrine,\" determining that escaping slaves who reached Union lines would be considered contrabandand not be returned to bondage. Even though Virginia had seceded from the Union in 1861, Fort Monroe stayed inUnion hands for the entirety of the Civil War and served as a haven for slaves escaping to freedom. In 1864, theUnion Army of the James under Major General Benjamin Butler was formed at Fort Monroe, which included two coloredregiments: the 2nd Regiment, United States Colored Cavalry and the 1st Regiment, United States Colored Cavalry.These regiments served gallantly in the Siege of Petersburg in 1864.",

Pressures had been building between the two nations over possessionof the San Juan Island group since 1846 when the Treaty of Oregon left ownership unclear. Thus came the \"Pig War\"crisis, at the height of which more than 500 U.S. Army soldiers and three British warships were nose to nose onthe island's southern shore, not 10 miles from Victoria, British Columbia.  Fortunately, officials on both sides quickly restored calm and the nations agreed to a joint militaryoccupation of the island until the boundary could be decided. The American soldiers and British Royal Marinesremained for 12 years until Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, as arbitrator, awarded the islands to the United States.",

From roller skating alongside a park ranger and picnicking in the park to fishing and boating along the Anacostia River, this park has something to offer for everyone.   The history of the Anacostia area is long and complex. The abundance of fish, game, and other natural resources has made the Anacostia River area a gathering space for over 10,000 years. The Nacotchtank lived in this area before the rapid settlement of the land by English landowners and rapid decline of the Nacotchtanks.

As an African American boy growing up in central Virginia during the late 19th century, he had feweducational or employment opportunities. In pursuit of a new life, he and his family moved to Huntington, WestVirginia, where he worked in the New River Gorge coalfields to help supplement the family's income. Finally, bythe time he was 20, Woodson saved enough money from his days as a coal miner to begin his formal education. In1912, Woodson became the second African American\u2014and the only one of slave parentage\u2014to earn a PhD from HarvardUniversity.  As the nation's first professionally trained historian of African descent, Woodson institutionalized thestudy of African American history, and from his home located at 1538 Ninth Street, N.W. in the heart of the city'sShaw Neighborhood, he directed the operations of his organization, the Association for the Study of Negro Life andHistory, ran a publishing company, the Associated Publishers, and in 1926, started Negro History Week, which isnow observed as Black History Month.  The home is open to the public and offers interpretive and educational programs throughout the year.",

                "description": "Thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail is on many serious hiker's bucket list, but the AT also has great day hikes and campgrounds for hikers of all levels.  The Appalachian National Scenic Trail is a 2,180-mile footpath along ridgecrests and across the majorvalleys of the Appalachian Mountains from Katahdin in Maine to Springer Mountain in northern Georgia. The trailtraverses Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland,West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia. The Appalachian Trail (AT) is used by day, weekendand other short-term hikers, section-hikers and thru-hikers (who hike the entire length of the trail, start tofinish, in one season).   The Appalachian Trail began as a vision of forester Benton MacKaye, was developed by volunteers, andopened as a continuous trail in 1937. It was designated as the first National Scenic Trail by the National TrailsSystem Act of 1968. The Trail is currently protected along more than 99 percent of its course by federal or stateownership of the land or by rights-of-way. Annually, more than 4,000 volunteers contribute more than 185,000 hoursof effort on the Appalachian Trail.",

It's built and maintained primarily by volunteers from the North Country Trail Association and its partners.   The National Park Foundation is supporting the North Country Trail by providing funds for a standardized chainsaw training program and the necessary personal protective equipment for volunteers across the trail's 4,800 miles to ensure the trail is safe and accessible for users. It also works closely with the trail's primary partner, the North Country Trail Association, which has recently received capacity building grants for the creation of a Trail Protection program that will enable NCTA to secure access to and protect the landscape of the trail, as well as the development of a campaign plan to increase NCTA's ability to sustain its maintenance, protection, and promotion of the trail long into the future.

This unique historic place preserves and interprets one of America's most important locations in thehistory of westward expansion and Indian resistance. In 1834, where the Cheyenne and Arapaho travelled, traded andhunted, a fur trading post was created. Soon to be known as Fort Laramie, it rested at a location that wouldquickly prove to be the path of least resistance across a continent. By the 1840s, wagon trains rested andresupplied here, bound for Oregon, California and Utah.  In 1849 as the Gold Rush of California drew more westward, Fort Laramie became a military post, and forthe next 41 years, would shape major events as the struggle between two cultures for domination of the northernplains increased into conflict. In 1876, Fort Laramie served as an anchor for military operations, communication,supply, and logistics during the \"Great Sioux War.\" Fort Laramie closed, along with the frontier it helped shapeand influence, in 1890.
