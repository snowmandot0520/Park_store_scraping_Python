                "description": "Amache, also known as the Granada Relocation Center, was one of 10 incarceration sites established by the War Relocation Authority to detain Japanese Americans who were forcibly removed from their homes on the West Coast of the United States during World War II. Operated under the terms of Executive Order 9066 from 1942-1945, over 10,000 people of Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of them American citizens, passed through Amache. At its peak population in 1943, 7,310 people were detained in Amache, making it the tenth largest city in Colorado at the time.   Though the original buildings associated with the incarceration site were removed or demolished after Amache closed in 1945, Amache represents one of the most intact examples of a World War II incarceration site. Today, Amache National Historic Site consists of a historic cemetery, a monument, concrete building foundations, the historic road network, and several reconstructed and rehabilitated structures from the camp era.   The designation of the Amache National Historic Site is an important step in telling a more complete story of the Japanese American incarceration during World War II. Many survivors, their descendants, and the Amache Preservation Society were instrumental in obtaining the initial National Historic Landmark designation and advocating for the site to become part of the National Park System.",

The adobe fort quickly became the center of the Bent, St.Vrain &Company's expanding trade empire that included Fort St.Vrain to the north and Fort Adobe to the south, along withcompany stores in Mexico at Taos and Santa Fe. The primary trade was with the Southern Cheyenne and ArapahoIndians for buffalo robes.  For much of its 16-year history, the fort was the only major permanent white settlement on the Santa FeTrail between Missouri and the Mexican settlements. The fort provided explorers, adventurers, and the U.S. Army aplace to get needed supplies, wagon repairs, livestock, good food and water, company, rest, and protection in thisvast \"Great American Desert.\"  During the war with Mexico in 1846, the fort became a staging area for Colonel Stephen Watts Kearny's\"Army of the West.\" Disasters and disease caused the fort's abandonment in 1849.  Archeological excavations and original sketches, paintings and diaries were used in the fort'sreconstruction in 1976.",

Builtbetween 1790-91 by Kamehameha I (also known as Kamehameha the Great), together with chiefs, commoners, men, womenand children. As British sailor John Young looked on, the temple was built and dedicated, a chief rival wassacrificed, and the war god Ku was pleased.  Kamehameha I waged several subsequent battles using Western military strategy and weapons to extend hiscontrol over all Hawaiian Islands. The monarchy he established lasted 83 years, from 1810-1893.   ",

By 1883, over 8,000 workers lived inPullman. Over the next decade, orders declined and wages were cut, but rent charged for company housing was not.Soon workers were left with starvation wages as corporate dividends remained undisturbed. A strike broke outin May 1894 and factory workers walked out after failed negotiations for better wages and living conditions. Thisled to a national boycott of handling Pullman cars, drastically affecting rail traffic across the country, andviolence and vandalism broke out as soldiers were dispatched to aid local authorities. The strike was eventuallyquelled by an injunction from the Supreme Court, but its effects were far-reaching.   In 1925, A. Phillip Randolphfounded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), the first African American labor union. At the time,porters made up 44% of the Pullman workforce, making it the nation's largest employer of African Americans.

Tallgrass prairie once covered more than 140 million acres of the United States, from Indiana toKansas and from Canada to Texas. Nearly all of it is gone, plowed under for agriculture. An ancient past survivesin the irreplaceable Flint Hills tallgrass.  In prehistory, what is now a sea of grass, was once a shallow sea of water. Two hundred to 300 millionyears ago the gray and white rock limestone and steel tough chert commonly called \"flint\" began to form from thisPermian Sea floor. The result was shallow, rocky land considered unsuitable for plowing but excellent for pasture.The natural prairie cycle of weather, wildfires, and animal grazing -- once bison, now cattle -- has sustained thetallgrass prairie and its diverse plant and animal species ever since.  Now you can find over 500 species of plants, nearly 150 species of birds, 39 species of reptiles andamphibians, and 31 species of mammals. Much of the prairie flora and fauna is far too tiny to be seen from apassing car. For those who take the time to stop and look closer, a subtle world of special beauty and naturalwonder is waiting.

In 1604, Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons, accompanied by Samuel Champlain and 77 other men, established asettlement on St. Croix Island. Preceding Jamestown (1607) and Plymouth (1620), Pierre Dugua's outpost was one ofthe earliest European settlements on the North Atlantic coast of North America. More specifically, it was thefirst attempt by the French at year-round colonization in the territory they called La Cadie or l'Acadie.  The settlement was short-lived, however, and in the summer of 1605, the French moved to a more favorablelocation where they established the Port Royal Habitation on the shores of the present-day Annapolis Basin, NovaScotia.  From St. Croix Island, Samuel Champlain explored and charted the coast of Norembegue (Norumbega),including the Bay of Fundy and the Atlantic coast as far south as Cape Cod. The valuable insights gained from boththe St. Croix settlement and further exploration formed the foundation for a more successful settlement at PortRoyal, and an enduring French presence in North American continuing to the present day.

More recently came theeastern investors and immigrants in one of the nation's first large mineral rushes. Copper built thrivingindustries and cosmopolitan communities in this remote, wild place. Mining companies like Calumet & Hecla andQuincy left a lasting mark on the land, communities and people. When the mines closed, their loss brought hardshipand heartache. Today, Keweenaw National Historical Park preserves the history and heritage of copper mining. Thepark also preserves the many stories associated with copper: stories of human struggle, ingenuity, vision andconflict.   ",

Stone pipes were long known among the prehistoric peoples of North America; specimens from 2,000 yearsago have been found at Mound City in present-day Ohio. Digging at this Minnesota quarry likely began in the 17thcentury, a time which coincided with the acquisition of metal tools from European traders. Carvers prized thisdurable yet relatively soft stone, which ranged from mottled pink to brick red. By all accounts this location cameto be the preferred source of pipestone among the Plains tribes.

In the spring of 1864, Major General William Sherman prepared his army to take Atlanta andsubsequently \"march to the sea.\" A primary concern of Sherman's was Major General Nathan Forrest's Confederatecorp of mounted infantry roving the mid-South. Sherman ordered several advances from Federally controlled Memphisinto north Mississippi for the purpose of keeping Forrest occupied in Mississippi and not behind his line in eastTennessee, cutting communication and supply lines.  On July 13-15, 1864, the Battle of Tupelo was the result of one of those advances by Major General AndrewJ. Smith. Although the Federals retreated to Memphis after the battle, it was a Federal victory: Forrest was notable to interfere with Sherman's Georgia campaign.   ",

Agate Fossil Beds National Monument is located in a unique unglaciated area of the High Plains, withwetlands stretching out from the river and buttes which contain important information about the life of mammals inthe Miocene Epoch.   During the Miocene, when the land was a grass savanna, it was home to prehistoric creatures such asthe Dinohyus (giant pig-like animal), Stenomylus (small gazelle-camel), and Menoceras (short rhinoceros). Theseanimals' hoofprints, as well as layers of fossilized bones, can be found throughout Agate. To preserve these richfossil deposits and their geological contexts, the park was founded amidst today's natural ecosystem.   Visitors to the park can also explore the more recent history of the area. The monument's museumcollection contains many interesting artifacts from the era when Captain James H. Cook, who befriended NativeAmericans traveling in the area and amassed an impressive collection of gifts from them, owned a nearby ranch.",

Wherever slavery existed, there were efforts to escape, at first to maroon communities in remoteor rugged terrain on the edge of settled areas. Their acts of self-emancipation made them 'fugitives' according tothe laws of the times, though in retrospect 'freedom seeker' seems a more accurate description. While most freedomseekers began their journey unaided and many completed their self-emancipation without assistance, each decade inwhich slavery was legal in the United States saw an increase in active efforts to assist escape. In many cases thedecision to assist a freedom seeker may have been a spontaneous reaction as the opportunity presented itself.However, in some places, particularly after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, the Underground Railroad wasdeliberate and organized.",

While they rested in its shade anddrank from the pool, many carved their signatures, dates, and messages.  Before the Spanish, petroglyphs were inscribed by Ancestral Puebloans living on top of the bluff over 700years ago. The softness of the sandstone made it easy to carve pictures, names, dates and messages. Ironically,that is also the reason that the famous inscriptions are slowly disappearing.

But aviable overland route across the remote deserts and mountains of Mexico's far northern frontier had to be found.It took the vision and courage of Mexican trader Antonio Armijo to lead the first commercial caravan from Abiqui,New Mexico, to Los Angeles late in 1829.  Over the next 20 years, Mexican and American traders continued to ply variants of the route that Armijopioneered, frequently trading with Indian tribes along the way. And it was from a combination of the indigenousfootpaths, early trade and exploration routes, and horse and mule routes that a trail network known collectivelyas the Old Spanish Trail evolved. Santa Fe emerged as the hub of the overland continental trade network linkingMexico and United States markets'a network that included not only the Old Spanish Trail, but also the Santa FeTrail and El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro.

A Midwesterner most of his life, Sandburg and his family moved to North Carolina in 1945. This farmoffered the peace and solitude required for his writing and offered Mrs. Sandburg over 30 acres of pasture-land toraise her champion dairy goats. Sandburg, having already achieved literary fame before relocating to NorthCarolina, continued to write and lecture and published more than one-third of his works during his 22 years atConnemara.

It's built and maintained primarily by volunteers from the North Country Trail Association and its partners.   The National Park Foundation is supporting the North Country Trail by providing funds for a standardized chainsaw training program and the necessary personal protective equipment for volunteers across the trail's 4,800 miles to ensure the trail is safe and accessible for users. It also works closely with the trail's primary partner, the North Country Trail Association, which has recently received capacity building grants for the creation of a Trail Protection program that will enable NCTA to secure access to and protect the landscape of the trail, as well as the development of a campaign plan to increase NCTA's ability to sustain its maintenance, protection, and promotion of the trail long into the future.

Shortly after terrorists flew airplanes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York andinto the Pentagon in Virginia, the 40 passengers and crew members on United Airlines Flight 93 fought a battle inthe sky over Pennsylvania. These 40 heroes voted and decided to fight back, thwarting a planned attack on ournation's capital. They saved the lives of many others, but sacrificed their own in a field just east of Pittsburghin Somerset County, Pennsylvania.  This was a day our country was shaken to its very foundation when terrorists coordinated hijacking offour commercial airlines in a strategically planned attack against the United States. Despite the destruction anddevastation, stories of courage and heroism emerged.",

African American slaves used the floodplain as a refuge and place to find liberty.After emancipation they fished Cedar Creek, hunted along its banks, and baptized children in its waters.   Today, Congaree is still a great place for fishing\u2014as well as hiking, camping, and boating.",

This unique national park incorporates several sites around Charleston Harbor that help share the uniquestories of the places and people that shaped our history. Sullivan's Island has long served as Charleston Harbor's first line of defense. Quarantine stations,constructed to prevent the spread of disease, checked every person that came into the harbor, including Africanswho were enslaved, and formal fortifications sought to defend against foreign invasion. Fort Moultrie, the firstfort on Sullivan's Island, was attacked in June 1776 by the Royal Navy while the fort was still incomplete andmanaged to drive out the British forces after nine hours of battle. Another fort was built in its place after theBritish captured Charleston in 1780, and a third brick Fort Moultrie was completed by 1809 after the second hadsuffered from neglect and a destructive hurricane. Fort Moultrie, named in honor of the commander who fought offthe Royal Navy in 1776, was modernized throughout the latter half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20thcentury and today the fort has been restored to portray the major periods of its complex history, from thePalmetto-log fort of 1776 to the World War II Harbor Entrance Control Post.  The nearby Fort Sumter was constructed on a man-made island as part of the Third System of SeacoastDefense \u2013 a network of forts meant to strengthen maritime defenses after the War of 1812. On April 21, 1861,following a chain reaction of social, economic, and political events, the first shots of the Civil War were firedat Fort Sumter. The Confederates garrisoned Fort Sumter for almost four years as the fort became the focus of along defense. The Siege of Charleston continued until February 17, 1865 \u2013 the longest siege in U.S. militaryhistory \u2013 and left the former three-tiered brick and masonry fort effectively a pile of rubble. Today the fort isaccessible by boat, and visitors can enjoy ranger talks and wayside exhibits that explore the fort's history andsignificance. Visitors to Charleston can also enjoy picnicking and casual recreational activities in outside theFort Sumter Visitor Education Center, located in Charleston's Liberty Square.",

The gunboats suffered such damage that the decks became slippery with blood. The strong artillerybombardment from the Cumberland River bluff crippled the ironclads, forcing them to retreat.  At daybreak the following morning, on a snow covered battleground, Southern forces launched a vigorousattack but failed to escape the clutches of Grant's army. On February 16th General Buckner felt compelled toaccept Grant's ultimatum: no terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. The gate wasopen for a Union invasion into the Confederate Heartland.

Some homeowners and Native American tribes were displaced to make room for the massivefacility, once home to over 50,000 workers. Tours are offered regularly from April-September, but requireregistration by internet, phone, or in person.  The atomic bombs were designed and built in Los Alamos, through the efforts of more than 6,000 scientistsand workers. There are three main areas of significance at Los Alamos including the Gun Site Facilities, where the'Little Boy' bomb was designed, the V-Site Facilities, where parts for the Trinity device were assembled, and thePajarito Site, which was used for additional assembly and research. There is currently no public access to DOEfacilities, but walking tours are available in the town of Los Alamos.  The Oak Ridge Reservation in rural eastern Tennessee was an industrial complex and city home to over75,000. This complex served as the headquarters for the Manhattan Project as well as a center for plutoniumproduction and uranium enrichment. The three areas of interest in Oak Ridge include the X-10 Graphite ReactorNational Historic Landmark, Buildings 9731 and 9204-3 at the Y-12 complex, and the location of the K-25 Building.These buildings were used for uranium enrichment, while the X-10 reactor produced plutonium.

Texas school districts perpetuated the practice of de facto segregation, with Hispanic students attending two-room adobe building now known as the Blackwell School. The school, named for longtime principal Jesse Blackwell, grew as more buildings were constructed next to the schoolhouse to accommodate a growing student population. Blackwell School, served hundreds of Hispanic children up to the ninth grade and closed in 1965 following the integration of the Marfa Independent School District.  Today, the site consists of the original 1909 adobe schoolhouse and a smaller 1927 classroom building, known as the Band Hall.

The wharf area of Christiansted once played an important rolein the mercantilist system that linked Europe, West Africa, the West Indies, and North America. From 1734 until1803, it was part of the infamous Triangular Trade. Slaves were acquired for cheap manufactured goods atfactories, or slaving forts, along the Guinea Coast of West Africa, and shipped to the West Indies via theinhumane Middle Passage.  At Christiansted, the slaves were auctioned off, and the ships cargoes replenished with local exportsbound for Europe and North America. Building materials, agricultural supplies, household furnishings, livestock,and foodstuffs were imported to help St. Croix meet the needs of its vigorous plantation economy. In turn, theisland exported sugar, molasses, rum, cotton, and tropical hardwood. Especially between 1760 and 1820, wealthderived from sugar, rum, and slaves enabled an extravagant life style among the upper class of St. Croix society.  The United States market accounted for approximately 75% of St. Croix's agricultural exports by 1830. Thesale of the Danish West Indies to the United States in 1917 only formalized an economic relationship that had longexisted between the Virgin Islands and the mainland.",

Opened in June 1998, Vermont's first national park preserves and interprets the historicMarsh-Billings-Rockefeller property.The Park is named for George Perkins Marsh, one of the nation's first globalenvironmental thinkers, who grew up on the property, and for Frederick Billings, an early conservationist whoestablished a progressive dairy farm and professionally managed forest on the former Marsh farm. FrederickBillings's granddaughter, Mary French Rockefeller, and her husband, conservationist Laurance S. Rockefeller,sustained Billings's mindful practices in forestry and farming on the property over the latter half of the 20thcentury. In 1983, they established the Billings Farm & Museum to continue the farm's working dairy and tointerpret rural Vermont life and agricultural history.  Walk through one of Vermont's most beautiful landscapes, under the shade of sugar maples and 400-year-oldhemlocks, across covered bridges and alongside rambling stone walls. This is a landscape of loss, recovery, andconservation. This is a story of stewardship, of people taking care of places - sharing an enduring connection toland and a sense of hope for the future.",

It's built and maintained primarily by volunteers from the North Country Trail Association and its partners.   The National Park Foundation is supporting the North Country Trail by providing funds for a standardized chainsaw training program and the necessary personal protective equipment for volunteers across the trail's 4,800 miles to ensure the trail is safe and accessible for users. It also works closely with the trail's primary partner, the North Country Trail Association, which has recently received capacity building grants for the creation of a Trail Protection program that will enable NCTA to secure access to and protect the landscape of the trail, as well as the development of a campaign plan to increase NCTA's ability to sustain its maintenance, protection, and promotion of the trail long into the future.

By the 1840s, wagon trains rested andresupplied here, bound for Oregon, California and Utah.  In 1849 as the Gold Rush of California drew more westward, Fort Laramie became a military post, and forthe next 41 years, would shape major events as the struggle between two cultures for domination of the northernplains increased into conflict.
