To seal off the bend of the river,the Upper Creeks built an incredibly strong 400 yard long barricade made of dirt and logs. As the Cherokee andLower Creek warriors swam the Tallapoosa and attacked from the rear, Jackson launched the militia and regularsoldiers against the barricade. Facing overwhelming odds, the Upper Creeks fought bravely yet ultimately lost thebattle. Over 800 Upper Creeks died at Horseshoe Bend defending their homeland. This was the final battle of theCreek War of 1813-14, which is considered part of the War of 1812.  In a peace treaty signed after the battle, both the Upper and Lower Creeks were forced to give the UnitedStates nearly 20 million acres of land in what is today Alabama and Georgia. The victory here brought AndrewJackson national attention and helped him to be elected the seventh President of the United States in 1828.",

The final push to achieve a nationwide solution to the disenfranchisementof African Americans came as the result of three strategically planned marches, the first of which took place onMarch 7. Nearly 500 marchers proceeded through the streets of Selma and across the Edmund Pettus Bridge where theywere faced by scores of Alabama State troopers. The troopers attacked the non-violent marchers, leaving many ofthem bloodied and severely injured, on a date forever ensconced in history as \" Bloody Sunday\".  A second march ended in a prayer session at the point of Sunday's confrontation. When an injunctioncircumventing the march to the Alabama State Capitol was reversed, a plan was devised to conduct the monumentaltrek on Sunday, March 21, 1965. Thousands of people, representing many races and nationalities, moved before theeyes of the world in demonstration to guarantee the right to vote. The five-day/four-night event covered a 54-mileroute along state Highway 80 through chilling weather and rain. The result was the personal triumph of those whoparticipated in the historic trek and the signing of the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965.

In the late 1920's and 1930's African Americans ingreat numbers began their love affair with flight. They learned the basics of flight on either American soil orabroad, and created their own flight schools and clubs.  This love affair was kindled in the late 1930's, when the United States Government created Civilian PilotTraining Programs throughout the country to provide a surplus of pilots in case of a national emergency. AfricanAmericans were included in these programs, although trained at segregated facilities.  Their love of flight became fully ablaze amid World War II as political pressure challenged thegovernment to expand the role of African Americans in the military. The Army Air Corps was the first agency toaccept the challenge. Tuskegee Institute, a small black college in Alabama, was selected to host the \"militaryexperiment\" to train African American pilots and support staff--thus the Tuskegee Airmen were born.  The outstanding performance of the over 15,000 men and women who shared the \"Tuskegee Experience\" from1942-1946, is immortalized at the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site.",

Grand Canyon National Park encompasses canyons, river tributaries, and surrounding grounds. The GrandCanyon is situated in Arizona's northwestern quadrant. With millions of visitors making the trip to the canyoneach year, this park is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world. In addition, the park has beena UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979.The Grand Canyon had a long and arduous road to becoming a national park, beginning in the 1880s withseveral failed congressional bills. After making multiple visits to the area, Theodore Roosevelt declared theGrand Canyon a National Monument in 1908. The bill to grant national park status to the area was passed in 1919and signed by then-President Woodrow Wilson.There are two public areas of Grand Canyon National Park, the North and South Rims. At 7,000 feet abovesea level, the Grand Canyon South Rim is the most accessible section of the national park, with numerous placeswhere visitors can pull over to admire the views. The Grand Canyon North Rim, 1,000 feet higher than its southernsibling, isn't as popular because it is harder to get to, especially when harsh winter weather closes accessroads. By car, the trip from one rim to the other is 220 miles. However, if traveling by foot, the distance acrossthe canyon is 21 miles via the Kaibab Trails.      ",

It was the first semi-permanent French settlement in the lower Mississippi River Valley. Theestablishment of the Post was the first step in a long struggle between France, Spain, and England over theinterior of the North American continent.  Over the years, the Post relocated as necessary due to flooding from the Arkansas River, but its positionalways served of strategic importance for the French, Spanish, American, and Confederate military. Spanishsoldiers and British partisans clashed here in the 1783 \"Colbert Raid,\" the only Revolutionary War action inArkansas.  Arkansas Post became part of the United States following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. By 1819, thepost was a thriving river port and the largest city in the region and selected as the first capital of theArkansas Territory.  During the Civil War, Confederate troops tried to maintain tactical control of the confluence of the tworivers, and in 1862 they constructed a massive earthen fortification known as Fort Hindman at the Post. In January1863 Union troops destroyed the fort, ensuring control of the Arkansas River.  Today, the memorial and museum commemorate the multi-layered and complex history of the site.

Rushed to completion at the beginning of the CivilWar, Fort Point was first garrisoned in February of 1861 by Company I, 3rd U.S. Artillery Regiment. The fort wasoccupied throughout the Civil War, but the advent of faster, more powerful rifled cannon made brick forts such asFort Point obsolete.
