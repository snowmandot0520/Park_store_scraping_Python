It was here, at the A.G. Gaston Motel in downtown Birmingham, where leaders from the SouthernChristian Leadership Conference and Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rightstook up residence in the spring of 1963 to strategize and make critical decisions that would propel the civilrights movement forward.  Known as \u201cProject C,\u201d the confrontation brought nationwide media attention as nonviolent protesters werethreatened by unleashed police dogs and high-pressure hoses.

On the morning of 27 March 1814, General Andrew Jackson and an army of 3,300 men consisting ofTennessee militia, United States regulars and both Cherokee and Lower Creek allies attacked Chief Menawa and 1,000Upper Creek warriors fortified in the \"horseshoe\" bend of the Tallapoosa River. To seal off the bend of the river,the Upper Creeks built an incredibly strong 400 yard long barricade made of dirt and logs. As the Cherokee andLower Creek warriors swam the Tallapoosa and attacked from the rear, Jackson launched the militia and regularsoldiers against the barricade. Facing overwhelming odds, the Upper Creeks fought bravely yet ultimately lost thebattle. Over 800 Upper Creeks died at Horseshoe Bend defending their homeland. This was the final battle of theCreek War of 1813-14, which is considered part of the War of 1812.  In a peace treaty signed after the battle, both the Upper and Lower Creeks were forced to give the UnitedStates nearly 20 million acres of land in what is today Alabama and Georgia. The victory here brought AndrewJackson national attention and helped him to be elected the seventh President of the United States in 1828.",

The Aniakchak Caldera, is the result of a series oferuptions, the latest in 1931. Covering some ten square miles, it is one of the finest examples of dry caldera inthe world. Located in the volcanically active Aleutian Mountains, the crater contains many outstanding examples ofvolcanic features, including lava flows, cinder cones, and explosion pits.  Surprise Lake, located within the caldera, is the source of the Aniakchak River, which cascades through a1,500-foot gash in the caldera wall. The site also contains the Aniakchak Wild River.",

The Bering Land BridgeNational Preserve is one of the most remote national parks in America, located on the Seward Peninsula innorthwest Alaska. The Preserve protects a small remnant of the land bridge that connected Asia and North Americamore than 10,000 years ago. Most of this land bridge, once thousands of miles wide, now lies beneath the waters ofthe Chukchi and Bering Seas.   During the Pleistocene Epoch, orlast Ice Age, glaciers in the northern region of the earth locked up water in the area, causing the sea levels todrop and exposing the land beneath the Bering Strait. Animals, plants, and people migrated from one continent toanother across this flat, grassy plain. As the Ice Age ended and the earth warmed, glaciers melted and the sealevels rose again, submerging most of the land bridge. Bering Land Bridge National Preserve protects the remnantof the land bridge for the study of past cultures, to learn more about the first people who set foot in America,and to support the traditional lifestyles of its residents.   Today, the preserveoffers unparalleled opportunities to experience some of America's most isolated wild lands and the rich heritageof Alaskan Native cultures, past and present. The land can be explored through camping, bird watching, hunting,gathering, trapping, and fishing.",
